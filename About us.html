                    <h2>About Starbucks</h2>
                    <p>Starbucks is an American company that operates the largest coffeehouse chain and one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company operates more than 35,000 stores across 80 countries</p>
                    <p>Although Starbucks was not the first major coffeehouse chain in the U.S., it was the first to both popularize and mass-distribute a particular brand of café culture. Starting in the 1990s, Starbucks began promoting coffee as a holistic experience that combined ambiance, community, function, and lifestyle. </p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Starbucks was founded by Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl, opening its first store in 1971 near the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle. The three Starbucks founders had two things in common: they were all coming from academia, and they all loved coffee and tea. They invested and borrowed some money to open the first store in Seattle and named it “Starbucks” after the first mate, Starbuck, in Herman Melville’s classic novel Moby Dick.</p>
                    <p>Alfred Peet, a coffee-roasting entrepreneur, was a major inspiration to the founders of Starbucks. Peet was a Dutch immigrant who had begun importing fine arabica coffees into the United States during the 1950s. In 1966 he opened a small store, Peet’s Coffee and Tea, in Berkeley, California, that specialized in importing first-rate coffees and teas. Peet’s success encouraged the Starbucks founders to base their business model on selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment, and Peet’s became the initial supplier of green coffee beans to Starbucks. The partners then purchased a used roaster from Holland, and Baldwin and Bowker experimented with Alfred Peet’s roasting techniques to create their own blends and flavours. </p>

                    <h2>Facts</h2>
                    <h3>Starbucks wasn't actually invented by coffee connoisseurs</h3>
                    <p> It's true! Although the man most associated with the coffee chain is chairman and CEO Howard Schultz, Starbucks was actually founded by three guys.
                        Gordon Bowker (a writer), Zev Siegl (a history teacher), and Jerry Baldwin (an English teacher) all joined forces in the 70s to open up the first Starbucks in Seattle. </p>
                        <h3>Starbucks owns a record label</h3>
                        <p> Hear Music was a record label that was founded in 2007 in a partnership between Concord Music Group and Starbucks. Early on, the record label signed Sir Paul McCartney, followed by others including James Taylor and Joni Mitchell.</p>

                        <h3>Coffee masters wear black aprons</h3>
                        <p>Baristas with black aprons are classed as certified "coffee masters," who will have previously completed Starbucks' educational programme, and they know everything there is to know about coffee. So, ask them as many coffee questions as you can!  </p>

                        <h3>There are over 87,000 possible drink combinations</h3>
                        <p>Chances are, you've heard of the coffee chain's secret menu, so you'll already know that there are tons and tons of drink combinations that aren't on the menu.

                            And if you think about it, it makes sense... they have a lot of syrups. Not to mention, some class baristas. </p>
